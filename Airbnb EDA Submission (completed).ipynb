By connecting hosts who have extra space in their homes or apartments with travelers looking for a more authentic and local experience, Airbnb has created a thriving community of people from all over the world who are passionate about exploring new cultures and sharing their own.\n","\n","As Airbnb has grown in popularity, the company has also recognized the value of data analysis in understanding its customers and hosts, making informed business decisions, and identifying new opportunities for growth. With millions of listings on its platform, Airbnb generates a vast amount of data that can be used to gain insights into the behavior and performance of hosts and guests.\n","\n","This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset of approximately 49,000 Airbnb listings in order to gain a better understanding of the factors that drive success on the platform. The dataset includes both categorical and numeric variables, such as the location of the listing, the type of property, the price, the number of reviews, and the amenities offered.\n","\n","One of the key questions we can explore using this data is what sets successful hosts apart from those who may be struggling. By examining variables such as the number of bookings and reviews, the location of the listings, and the amenities offered, we can identify patterns and trends that may be correlated with higher levels of success.\n","\n","In addition to studying the characteristics of individual hosts, we can also use the data to understand the factors that influence demand for Airbnb listings in different areas. Factors such as the availability of local attractions, the cost of living, and the overall quality of life in an area may all play a role in determining the popularity of Airbnb listings.\n","\n","Another area of interest for Airbnb is predicting future demand and pricing for its listings. By using machine learning techniques such as regression or classification, we can build models that can predict the likelihood of a listing being booked or the expected price based on factors such as the location, type of property, and amenities offered. These predictions can be valuable for both hosts and guests, as they can help hosts set competitive prices and guests make informed decisions about where to stay.\n","\n","Overall, the data generated by Airbnb's millions of listings provides a rich source of information that can be used to understand the behavior and preferences of hosts and guests, make informed business decisions, and identify new opportunities for growth and innovation. By exploring and analyzing this data, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that drive success on Airbnb and use this knowledge to drive the company's continued success."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["As Airbnb continues to expand and grow, it is important for the company to to use data analysis to gain insights into the behavior and performance of hosts and customers on the Airbnb platform, and to use this knowledge to inform business decisions and identify opportunities for growth and innovation.

first changed data type for 'last_review' feature as it represent date but had object data type. so change it into datetime data type. Secondly, it was important to deal with null values before feature engineering as the scope of this project was to find relation amoung different features and find the trend and pattern and null values can skew the result, therefore i changed the name and host_name null value with 'not known'. Since total count of number of review equal to zero was equal to the count of null values in review per month, and as there was no review for the month therefore review per month should also be zero therefore, i changed null value with zero. Thirdly, since minimum value for price was zero, and since there is no specific data available why it was zero for example whether any discount was given or because of some other reason, therefore i changed zero value with median as median is less sensitive to the presence of outliers than the mean, and can provide a more accurate representation of the central tendency of the data in these cases. Next added new column - number_of_booking and potenial_revenue_per_year as it will be helpful in forecasting potential revenue it can generate throughout year if ideally booked based on availability. Finally dropped the last_review date column even though it can be used to know how old our data can be and in sentiment analysis, but in the context of this analysis it may not be used and also dropped id column because the feature will not have any variability - every row will have a unique value, so the feature will not be able to provide any information about the relationship between the target variable and the feature. Ignored availability_365 zero values to understand how these values are affecting overall business as being an airbnb host you should be available for atleast more than 1 day in entire year, its better to figure out what the reason may be,so a better anlysis on these number was needed. Then dumped the cleaned data into csv format for visual anlaysis in tableau.\n","\n","After making consistent data, calculated to mean, median, minimum, maximum and sum for each feature, later grouped neighbourhood_group and room type to check what does maximum and minimum price show customer engagement.
